some projects of 1st semester 


1. Feature Engineer
It is a good way to use color histogram to observe the color distribution and it is not sensible to the direction and size of the image.Then I resized the image to 64x64 and normalized the histogram features into pure values in order to add weights.


2. Find the best K for Kmeans
I applied silhouette coefficient to evaluate the result of clustering. The value is between 1 and -1, the larger the value the better effect. From enumerating several times the algorithm of Means from K=2 to K=14, the best K value is found to be 2.
